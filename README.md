DropBy
====

DropBy is a web application that can be used to post and find events happening on UCSD's campus. It is build using a combination of HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Node.js. Users can browse local events, add their own events, and browese the events they have created themselves. While this is an early iteration of the idea, it can be expanded upon further in the future.
